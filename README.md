## Topics Recap
1. Recursion
    * Concepts
        * A function that calls itself repeatedly
        * A recursive algorithm is an algorithm that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems and applies the same algorithm to solve the smaller subproblems.
        * The base case is the case where a recursive algorithm actually does some final work--grading the one exam in the previous case.
    * Rule of Thumb to appproach a problem recursively
        * Base-case -- what is the simplest form of your problem?
        * Sub-problems -- how to break the problem in to smaller problem and solve them

## Recap Example
In RecapExample.java, there are 2 methods to be implemented. We will be going through these examples during recitation.

1. Use Recursion to Print a String in reverse order
2. Use Recursion to count the number of digits in a positive integer

---
## Recitation Problem Set
Complete Q0 + (EITHER Q1-Q3 OR Q4-Q5) in ProblemSet.java. 

0. Use D.R.Y. principle to improve a method's readability and testablity
1. Implement factorial() using Recursion
2. Count the number of 'x' in a String using Recursion
3. Reverse a String using Recursion
4. Count the number of '1' in the bit representation of a int, use Recursion
5. Find all the permutation of an arraylist of numbers, using Recursion

### What to Submit?
Submit (Q0 + Q1-Q3) or (Q0 + Q4-Q5)
Copy and paste your code into gradscopes.
